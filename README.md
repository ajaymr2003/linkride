LinkRide: Intelligent Car and Bike Ride Sharing Platform is a 
mobile application–based system designed to reduce traffic 
congestion, fuel wastage, and environmental pollution by encouraging 
shared transportation. In daily travel, many cars and bikes move with 
empty seats, while people struggle to find safe, affordable, and timely 
rides. The main aim of the LinkRide system is to make better use of 
available vehicle seats by connecting drivers and passengers through a 
single mobile platform. 
The application allows drivers to post ride details such as route, time, 
available seats, and ride type, while passengers can search and book 
rides easily based on their needs. Intelligent ride matching helps users 
find suitable rides quickly and efficiently. The system focuses on user 
safety and trust by providing features such as identity verification, 
live GPS tracking, ratings and reviews, and emergency alert options. 
Additional safety features like Smart Trust Score and Guardian Mode 
help ensure secure travel, especially during night rides, by monitoring 
routes and sharing live updates with trusted contacts. 
By digitizing and automating the entire ride-sharing process through a 
mobile application, LinkRide provides a reliable, transparent, and 
user-friendly solution for daily commuting. The system also supports 
real-time notifications, secure in-app communication, and ride history 
tracking for better user experience. Overall, LinkRide helps reduce 
traffic congestion, saves fuel, lowers travel costs, and promotes eco
friendly, community-based transportation, making daily travel more 
efficient and sustainable.
